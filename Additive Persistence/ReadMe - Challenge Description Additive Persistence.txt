# DAILY CHALLENGE Ð Additive Persistence:# additive persistence is defined as how many loops you have to do summing # an integer's digits until you get a single digit number. Take an integer N:# 1. Add its digits# 2. Repeat until the result has 1 digit# The total number of iterations is the additive persistence of N.# Examples# 13 -> 1 # 1234 -> 2 # 9876 -> 2 # 199 -> 3
